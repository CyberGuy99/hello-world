# hello-world
This is another repository, but more importantly, my first one

Well, this readme has no other purpose than to inform that this repository is useless except for an area to experiment with github.


I guess this tutorial wants me to add more to this useless md file. Oh well, since this is public I'm not really going to talk about myself
I'll create a fictional character or is it real? That is for the audience to find out.
So, I live in a pretty big state, country, planet - compared to mercury. What I like doing... I actually don't have much preferences other than saving the day and having fun, which can be easily achieved by soaring through the galaxy and collecting gold stars, maybe even fighting a abnormally large King horned-turtle that stands on two legs and breathes fire. Aah, I'm out of time!
